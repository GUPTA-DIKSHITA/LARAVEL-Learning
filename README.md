LARAVEL is a great framework to make responsive websites in a few simple steps. This PHP based framework provides built-in support for controllers and model. You should definitely try the MVC framework

## GETTING STARTED
For running a project in Laravel, you need to follow the below steps-
1. install composer in your machine, you can visit the official laravel composer page for downloading 
2. after installing composer, install laravel using the command "composer global require laravel/installer"
3. once installed, create your project using "composer create-project project name"
4. now work on your project using any editor(example: VS Code)
5. Once done with the final changes, use "php artisan serve" to locally host your project on PHP's built-in development server to serve your application
6. For more commands, you can visit the official laravel documentary

## DEPLOYMENT

You can fork the project and run the code (possibly in VS Code)
First create the view using model-view-controller (in app directory)
Run "php artisan make:migration table name" to create table in phpMyAdmin local database. 
Then after writing the necessary code in migrations directory, run "php artisan migrate". This command will create the fields and apply necessary checks such as primary key, foreign key constraints.
Finally run "php artisan serve" command to run the deployment server
